This folder contains an example based on the IEEE 13-bus test feeder developed by Paulo Radatz de Freitas in Sao Paulo, Brazil for his undergraduate project. It contains a report (in Portuguese) that is an excellent explanation of how OpenDSS works and the DSS files.

There is vibrant OpenDSS user community in Brazil that should welcome this contribution. It should also serve to inspire other users, particularly student users, around the world.
