MVAsc1	MVA Short Circuit, 1-phase fault. Default = 2100. The "single-phase impedance", Zs, is determined by squaring the base kV and dividing by this value. Then Z0 is determined by Z0 = 3Zs - 2Z1.  For 1-phase sources, Zs is used directly. Use X0R0 to define X/R ratio for 1-phase source.
MVAsc3	MVA Short circuit, 3-phase fault. Default = 2000. Z1 is determined by squaring the base kv and dividing by this value. For single-phase source, this value is not used.
phases	Number of phases.  Defaults to 3.
pu	Per unit of the base voltage that the source is actually operating at."pu=1.05"
puZ0	2-element array: e.g., [1  2]. An alternate way to specify Z0. See Z0 property. Per-unit zero-sequence impedance on base of Vsource BasekV and BaseMVA.
puZ1	2-element array: e.g., [1  2]. An alternate way to specify Z1. See Z1 property. Per-unit positive-sequence impedance on base of Vsource BasekV and BaseMVA.
puZ2	2-element array: e.g., [1  2]. An alternate way to specify Z2. See Z2 property. Per-unit negative-sequence impedance on base of Vsource BasekV and BaseMVA.
R0	Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Zero-sequence resistance, ohms.  Default is 1.9.
R1	Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Positive-sequence resistance, ohms.  Default is 1.65.
ScanType	{pos*| zero | none} Maintain specified sequence for harmonic solution. Default is positive sequence. Otherwise, angle between phases rotates with harmonic.
Sequence	{pos*| neg | zero} Set the phase angles for the specified symmetrical component sequence for non-harmonic solution modes. Default is positive sequence. 
spectrum	Name of harmonic spectrum for this source.  Default is "defaultvsource", which is defined when the DSS starts.
X0	Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Zero-sequence reactance, ohms.  Default is 5.7.
x0r0	Zero-sequence X/R ratio.Default = 3.
X1	Alternate method of defining the source impedance. Positive-sequence reactance, ohms.  Default is 6.6.
x1r1	Positive-sequence  X/R ratio. Default = 4.
Yearly	LOADSHAPE object to use for the per-unit voltage for YEARLY-mode simulations. Set the Mult property of the LOADSHAPE to the pu curve. Qmult is not used. If UseActual=Yes then the Mult curve should be actual L-N kV.Must be previously defined as a LOADSHAPE object. Is set to the Daily load shape when Daily is defined.  The daily load shape is repeated in this case. Set to NONE to reset to no loadahape for Yearly mode. The default is no variation.
Z0	Zero-sequence equivalent source impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: Z0=[3, 4]  ! represents 3 + j4 Used to define the impedance matrix of the VSOURCE if Z1 is also specified. Note: Z0 defaults to Z1 if it is not specifically defined. 
Z1	Positive-sequence equivalent source impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: Z1=[1, 2]  ! represents 1 + j2 If defined, Z1, Z2, and Z0 are used to define the impedance matrix of the VSOURCE. Z1 MUST BE DEFINED TO USE THIS OPTION FOR DEFINING THE MATRIX.Side Effect: Sets Z2 and Z0 to same values unless they were previously defined.
Z2	Negative-sequence equivalent source impedance, ohms, as a 2-element array representing a complex number. Example: Z2=[1, 2]  ! represents 1 + j2 Used to define the impedance matrix of the VSOURCE if Z1 is also specified. Note: Z2 defaults to Z1 if it is not specifically defined. If Z2 is not equal to Z1, the impedance matrix is asymmetrical.
