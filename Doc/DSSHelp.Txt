BuildY	Forces rebuild of Y matrix upon next Solve command regardless of need. The usual reason for doing this would be to reset the matrix for another load level when using LoadModel=PowerFlow (the default) when the system is difficult to solve when the load is far from its base value.

Property	Description
(1) phases	Number of phases this transformer. Default is 3.
(2) windings	Number of windings, this transformers. (Also is the number of terminals) Default is 2.
(3) wdg	Set this = to the number of the winding you wish to define.  Then set the values for this winding.  Repeat for each winding.  Alternatively, use the array collections (buses, kvas, etc.) to define the windings.  Note: reactances are BETWEEN pairs of windings; they are not the property of a single winding.
(4) conn	Connection of this winding. Default is "wye" with the neutral solidly grounded.
(5) kV	For 2-or 3-phase, enter phase-phase kV rating.  Otherwise, kV rating of the actual winding
(6) kVA	Base kVA rating of the winding. Side effect: forces change of max normal and emerg kva ratings.If 2-winding transformer, forces other winding to same value. When winding 1 is defined, all other windings are defaulted to the same rating and the first two winding resistances are defaulted to the %loadloss value.
(7) tap	Per unit tap that this winding is normally on.
(8) %R	Percent resistance this winding.  (half of total for a 2-winding).
(9) Rneut	Default = -1. Neutral resistance of wye (star)-connected winding in actual ohms.If entered as a negative value, the neutral is assumed to be open, or floating.
(10) Xneut	Neutral reactance of wye(star)-connected winding in actual ohms.  May be + or -.
(11) conns	Use this to specify all the Winding connections at once using an array. Example:New Transformer.T1 buses="Hibus, lowbus" ~ conns=(delta, wye)

(18) Xscarray	Use this to specify the percent reactance between all pairs of windings as an array. All values are on the kVA base of winding 1.  The order of the values is as follows:(x12 13 14... 23 24.. 34 ..)  There will be n(n-1)/2 values, where n=number of windings.
